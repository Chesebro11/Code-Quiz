# Code-Quiz

- The quiz is built using javascript and DOM

- When the user clicks the start button a timer begins to count down, every incorrect answer subtracts 10 seconds from the timer

- every correct answer increases a score counter

- end of the quiz your score is displayed and a prompt to enter in initials

- these two values are saved in local storage to be displayed on the highscores page

- It looks bad because I do not like css sorry :/
